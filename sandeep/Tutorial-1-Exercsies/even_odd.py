# Write a function called showNumbers that takes a parameter called limit.
# It should print all the numbers between 0 and limit with a label to identify the even and odd numbers.
# For example, if the limit is 3, it should print:
#  - 0 EVEN
#  - 1 ODD
#  - 2 EVEN
#  - 3 ODD


def showNumbers(limit):
    for number in range(0, limit):
        if number % 2 == 0:
            print(f"{number}  {'EVEN'}")
        else:
            print(f"{number}  {'ODD'}")
