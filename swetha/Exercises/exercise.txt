Basics

    What is an expression?
    An expression is that when we combine two operands with an operator to produce a result. eg: c = a + b

    What is a syntax error?
    If we write the syntax wrong then we may get syntax error. eg: print("Hi there!".
    Here in this example we missed to close the right paranthesis generating syntax error.

    What is PEP8?
    PEP8 is used to indent the code by deleting extra white spaces.

    What does a linter do?
    Linter analyses the code and shows us if there is any error before executing the program. 

    What is the result of this expression: “*” * 10
    **********

    What is CPython?
    How is CPython different from Jython?
    How is CPython different from IronPython?



Primitive Types

    What is a variable?
    A variable is a memory name which allocates some space in the memory to store a value in it. eg: a = 10.

    What are the primitive built-in types in Python?
    Number(Integer, Float, Complex number) 
    String 
    Boolean

    When should we use “”” (tripe quotes) to define strings?
    1. If we are writing data in multiple lines then we can use it.
    eg: message = """ 
    Hi
    pradeep
    How are you doing? """

    2. If we use both double quotes and single quotes in the string then we can use """ to differentiate from them
    eg: message = """ Nirvaan's Date of Birth is "August" 23rd 2018 """

    What is the result of f“{2+2}+{10%3}”?
    41

    Given (name = “john smith”), what will name.title() return?
    john smith

    What does name.strip() do?
    Its strips or removes the extra white spaces from beginning and end of the name

    What will name.find(“Smith”) return?
    It return the index of the string which is 5

    What will be the value of name after we call name.replace(“j”, “k”)?
    "kohn smith"

    How can we check to see if name contains “John”?

    What are the 3 types of numbers in Python?
    Integer(eg: 3)
    Float (eg: 3.333)
    Complex number (eg: 2 + 3j where 2 is real part and 3j is the imaginary part)



Control Flow

    What is the difference between 10 / 3 and 10 // 3?
    10 / 3 gives the quotient with decimal part - 3.333333
    10 // 3 gives the quotient without the decimal part - 3

    What is the result of 10 ** 3?
    ** is 10 to the power of 3 - 1000

    Given (x = 1), what will be the value of after we run (x += 2)?
    x += 2 is similar to x = x + 2 => 3

    How can we round a number?
    round()
    eg: round(2.999) => 3

    What is the result of float(1)?
    1.0000

    What is the result of bool(“False”)?
    True

    What are the falsy values in Python?
    None
    0
    False
    ""
    What is the result of 10 == “10”?
    False

    What is the result of “bag” > “apple”?
    True

    What is the result of not(True or False)?
    False

    Under what circumstances does the expression 18 <= age < 65 evaluate to True?
    eg: age 22 => (18 <= age) and (age < 65)
    What does range(1, 10, 2) return?
    1
    3
    5
    7
    9

    Name 3 iterable objects in Python.
    range
    list(*numbers)
    keyword arguments(**users)



Functions

    What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
    An argument is the values we pass it to the function declaration
    A parameter is the actual values we pass it the function when we are calling it.

    All functions in Python by default return …?
    None

    What are keyword arguments and when should we use them?
    keyword aruments are the key-values pairs we use them to create tuples or records 

    How can we make a parameter of a function optional?
    eg: def add(x, y=1):
            x = x + y
        add(4)

    What happens when we prefix a parameter with an asterisk (*)?
    it generates a list

    What about two asterisks (**)?
    it is used to create key - value pairs

    What is scope?
    The life span of a variable.

    What is the difference between local and global variables?
    ->local variables are the variables which are declared in a method and their scope is limited to the block itself
    and we cannot call the local variables out side the block.

    ->Global variables are the variables which are declared oustide the function and the scope is limited to the entire program.
    we can call the variables inside the function block or outside the function.
    
    Why is using the global statement a bad practice?
    global statement is used to refer the global variable inside the function.
    If we change the value inside the function, it changes the value of the global variable 
    where ever we used it in the problem. So it results in getting errors or producing different output
