# Tuples are similar to lists But we cannot add new items are modify them.
# We cannot remove the eisting items.
# Tuples are immutable. We can not mutate or change them
# These are denoted using parenthesis whereas
# lists are denoted with square brackets

# mostly we use lists in the programs but if you want
# the list to be un-modified through out the program then we use tuple
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
# we can not assign a value to the tuples
# numbers[0] = 10  # TypeError
print(numbers[0])  # 1
